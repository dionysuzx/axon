Axon can create and open timestamped notes. This guide covers setup and usage for daily, weekly, monthly, and scratch notes.

## Prerequisites

- [yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/) — terminal file manager, used to open notes
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) — fuzzy finder, used by TUI search

## Setup

### 1. Set Your Notes Directory

By default, notes are stored in `$HOME/notes`. To use a different directory, set the `AXON_NOTES_DIR` environment variable:

```bash
# In your shell profile (.bashrc, .zshrc, config.fish, etc.)
export AXON_NOTES_DIR="$HOME/documents/notes"
```

### 2. Create Templates (Optional)

Create template files in your notes directory:

```bash
mkdir -p "$AXON_NOTES_DIR/templates"
```

Example daily template (`$AXON_NOTES_DIR/templates/daily.md`):

```markdown
# Daily Note

## Tasks
- [ ]

## Notes

## End of Day
```

### 3. Configure axon.toml

Create `axon.toml` in your notes directory to link templates to note types:

```toml
[schemas]
"daily.*.md" = "templates/daily.md"
"weekly.*.md" = "templates/weekly.md"
"monthly.*.md" = "templates/monthly.md"
```

Now every new note matching a pattern will be pre-populated with its template.

## Note Types

| Type | Filename Format | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Daily | `daily.YYYY.MM.DD.md` | `daily.2025.01.15.md` |
| Weekly | `weekly.YYYY.MM.DD.md` (Monday's date) | `weekly.2025.01.13.md` |
| Monthly | `monthly.YYYY.MM.md` | `monthly.2025.01.md` |
| Scratch | `scratch.{unix_timestamp}.md` | `scratch.1737000000.md` |

## Usage

### From the Command Line

```bash
axon d
```

This creates `daily.YYYY.MM.DD.md` (if it doesn't exist) and opens it in yazi.

### From the TUI

Run `axon` to enter the TUI, then use the shortcut keys:

| Key | Note Type |
|-----|-----------|
| `d` | Daily |
| `w` | Weekly |
| `m` | Monthly |
| `s` | Scratch |

The TUI suspends while yazi is open and resumes when you close it.

You can also browse all notes with `j`/`k` navigation, open one with `Enter`, or fuzzy search with `/`.

## How It Works

1. Axon resolves the notes directory (`$AXON_NOTES_DIR` or `$HOME/notes`)
2. Generates the filename based on the note type and current date/time
3. If the file doesn't exist:
   - Creates the notes directory (if needed)
   - Loads `axon.toml` and checks `[schemas]` for a matching glob pattern
   - If a match is found, reads the template file and writes it as the initial content
   - If no match (or template is missing), creates an empty file
4. Opens the file in yazi

## Multiple Templates

You can use different templates for different periods:

```toml
[schemas]
"daily.2025.01.*.md" = "templates/january.md"
"daily.*.md" = "templates/daily.md"
```

The first matching pattern wins, so put more specific patterns first.

## Tips

- Keep templates minimal — they should be starting points, not rigid structures
- Notes are never validated by `axon health` (they don't follow the feat/SOP pattern)
- Use scratch notes for quick capture — each one gets a unique timestamp
