description: axon.toml format and options
---

Axon uses an optional `axon.toml` configuration file located in the notes directory.

## File Location

The config file is loaded from `axon.toml` inside the notes directory:

- `$AXON_NOTES_DIR/axon.toml` (if `$AXON_NOTES_DIR` is set)
- `$HOME/notes/axon.toml` (default)

If the file does not exist, axon uses default settings. If the file exists but is invalid TOML, defaults are used silently.

## Format

```toml
[schemas]
"daily.*.md" = "templates/daily.md"
"daily.2025.01.*.md" = "templates/january.md"
```

## Schemas Table

The `[schemas]` table maps glob patterns to template file paths. When axon creates a new note (daily, weekly, monthly, or scratch), it checks each pattern against the filename. The first matching pattern's template is used as the initial file content.

### Glob Matching

Patterns support `*` as a wildcard that matches any sequence of characters:

| Pattern | Matches | Doesn't Match |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| `daily.*.md` | `daily.2025.01.15.md` | `notes.md` |
| `daily.2025.01.*.md` | `daily.2025.01.15.md` | `daily.2025.02.01.md` |
| `*.md` | Any `.md` file | `file.txt` |

Patterns without `*` require an exact match.

### Template Paths

Template paths are relative to the notes directory. For example, with `$AXON_NOTES_DIR` set to `/home/user/notes`:

```toml
[schemas]
"daily.*.md" = "templates/daily.md"
```

This reads the template from `/home/user/notes/templates/daily.md`.

If the template file does not exist, the daily note is created empty (no error is raised).
