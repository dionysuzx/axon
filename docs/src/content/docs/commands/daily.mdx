title: axon d
description: Open today's daily note
---

Creates (if needed) and opens today's daily note in yazi.

## Usage

```bash
axon d
```

## Filename Format

Daily notes use the format:

```
daily.YYYY.MM.DD.md
```

For example, a note created on January 15, 2025 would be named `daily.2025.01.15.md`.

## Notes Directory

The notes directory is resolved in this order:

1. `$AXON_NOTES_DIR` environment variable (if set)
2. `$HOME/notes` (default)

If the directory does not exist, axon creates it automatically.

## Schema Templates

When creating a new daily note, axon checks `axon.toml` in the notes directory for a matching schema template. If a glob pattern in the `[schemas]` table matches the filename, the referenced template file is used as the initial content.

Example `axon.toml`:

```toml
[schemas]
"daily.*.md" = "templates/daily.md"
```

With a template at `templates/daily.md` (relative to the notes directory):

```markdown
# Daily Note

## Tasks
- [ ]

## Notes

## End of Day
```

When axon creates `daily.2025.01.15.md`, it populates it with the template content. If no schema matches or the template file is missing, the note is created empty.

See [Configuration](/reference/config/) for more details on `axon.toml`.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success |
