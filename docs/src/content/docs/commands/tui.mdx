title: axon (TUI)
description: Interactive terminal user interface
---

Running `axon` with no arguments launches the terminal UI for browsing and managing notes.

## Usage

```bash
axon
```

## Prerequisites

- [yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/) — terminal file manager, used to open notes
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) — fuzzy finder, used by `/` search

## Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `Down` | Move selection down |
| `k` / `Up` | Move selection up |
| `Enter` | Open selected note in yazi |
| `/` | Fuzzy search notes with fzf |
| `d` | Open today's daily note |
| `w` | Open this week's weekly note |
| `m` | Open this month's monthly note |
| `s` | Create and open a scratch note |
| `q` | Quit |
| `Ctrl+C` | Quit |

## Behavior

The TUI uses an alternate screen buffer, so your terminal history is preserved when you exit. The screen displays:

- A centered **axon** title
- A scrollable list of notes from your notes directory
- A keybinding legend at the bottom

### Note List

The TUI lists all `.md` files in your notes directory (excluding `schema.*` files), sorted alphabetically. The selected note is highlighted in cyan. The list scrolls automatically to keep the selection visible.

### Fuzzy Search

Pressing `/` opens fzf with the current note list. You can:

- **Select an existing note** — opens it in yazi
- **Type a new name** — creates the note (with schema template if configured) and opens it in yazi

### Note Shortcuts

The `d`, `w`, `m`, and `s` keys create notes if they don't exist (applying schema templates from `axon.toml`) and open them in yazi:

| Key | Filename Format | Example |
|-----|----------------|---------|
| `d` | `daily.YYYY.MM.DD.md` | `daily.2025.01.15.md` |
| `w` | `weekly.YYYY.MM.DD.md` (Monday's date) | `weekly.2025.01.13.md` |
| `m` | `monthly.YYYY.MM.md` | `monthly.2025.01.md` |
| `s` | `scratch.{unix_timestamp}.md` | `scratch.1737000000.md` |

After returning from yazi, the note list refreshes automatically.

### Terminal Handling

The TUI uses crossterm for terminal management:

- Enables raw mode for keyboard input
- Enters the alternate screen buffer
- Hides the cursor
- On exit (or before launching yazi/fzf), all terminal state is restored

The screen redraws on terminal resize events.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Normal exit |
| `1` | Terminal error |
